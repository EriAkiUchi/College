Project to draw a canvas that has coordinates.  
  
Developed with other students.  
Each coordinate is stored in a queue. Then, it is possible to execute all changes on the canvas at once using the queue.  
Additionally, coordinates can be saved to a file and also read from the same file to store in the queue.
