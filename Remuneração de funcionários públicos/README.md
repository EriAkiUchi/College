Search average, lowest, and biggest gross salary;  
Search the Most common job, and its percentage;  
Search for the average salary of a specific job;  
Search for the Top 10 Units with the most employees;

A binary search tree was used to store the file data at runtime. It is also possible to manipulate the CSV file: add line, save, and read.
